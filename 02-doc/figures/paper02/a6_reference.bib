@article{baddooAcousticScatteringCascades2020a,
	abstract = {, We present a solution for the scattered field caused by an incident wave interacting with an infinite cascade of blades with complex boundary conditions. This extends previous studies by allowing the blades to be compliant, porous or satisfy a generalised impedance condition. Beginning with the convected wave equation, we employ Fourier transforms to obtain an integral equation amenable to the Wiener\textendash Hopf method. This Wiener\textendash Hopf system is solved using a method that avoids the factorisation of matrix functions. The Fourier transform is inverted to obtain an expression for the acoustic potential function that is valid throughout the entire domain. We observe that the principal effect of complex boundary conditions is to perturb the zeros of the Wiener\textendash Hopf kernel, which correspond to the duct modes in the inter-blade region. We focus efforts on understanding the role of porosity, and present a range of results on sound transmission and generation. The behaviour of the duct modes is discussed in detail in order to explain the physical mechanisms behind the associated noise reductions. In particular, we show that cut-on duct modes do not exist for arbitrary porosity coefficients. Conversely, the acoustic far-field modes are unchanged by modifications to the boundary conditions. We apply our solution to a cascade of perforated plates and see that a fractional open area of 1~\% is sufficient to significantly attenuate backscattering. The solution is essentially analytic (the only numerical requirements are matrix inversion and root finding) and is therefore extremely rapid to compute.},

@article{baddooKernelLearningRobust2021,
	abstract = {Research in modern data-driven dynamical systems is typically focused on the three key challenges of high dimensionality, unknown dynamics, and nonlinearity. The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a cornerstone for modeling high-dimensional systems from data. However, the quality of the linear DMD model is known to be fragile with respect to strong nonlinearity, which contaminates the model estimate. In contrast, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) learns fully nonlinear models, disambiguating the linear and nonlinear effects, but is restricted to low-dimensional systems. In this work, we present a kernel method that learns interpretable data-driven models for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. Our method performs kernel regression on a sparse dictionary of samples that appreciably contribute to the underlying dynamics. We show that this kernel method efficiently handles high-dimensional data and is flexible enough to incorporate partial knowledge of system physics. It is possible to accurately recover the linear model contribution with this approach, disambiguating the effects of the implicitly defined nonlinear terms, resulting in a DMD-like model that is robust to strongly nonlinear dynamics. We demonstrate our approach on data from a wide range of nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations that arise in the physical sciences. This framework can be used for many practical engineering tasks such as model order reduction, diagnostics, prediction, control, and discovery of governing laws.},

@article{banksEvaluationFCTMethod2009,
	abstract = {This study considers the development and assessment of a Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) algorithm for simulating high-speed flows on structured overlapping grids. This class of algorithm shows promise for solving some difficult highly-nonlinear problems where robustness and control of certain features, such as maintaining positive densities, is important. Complex, possibly moving, geometry is treated through the use of structured overlapping grids. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is employed to ensure sharp resolution of discontinuities in an efficient manner. Improvements to the FCT algorithm are proposed for the treatment of strong rarefaction waves as well as rarefaction waves containing a sonic point. Simulation results are obtained for a set of test problems and the convergence characteristics are demonstrated and compared to a high-resolution Godunov method. The problems considered are an isolated shock, an isolated contact, a modified Sod shock-tube problem, a two-shock Riemann problem, the Shu-Osher test problem, shock impingement on single cylinder, and irregular Mach reflection of a strong shock striking an inclined plane.},

@article{hurskyAdjointModelingAcoustic2004,
	abstract = {The use of adjoint modeling for acoustic inversion is investigated. An adjoint model is derived from a linearized forward propagation model to propagate data-model misfit at the observation points back through the medium to the medium perturbations not being accounted for in the model. This adjoint model can be used to aid in inverting for these unaccounted medium perturbations. Adjoint methods are being applied to a variety of inversion problems, but have not drawn much attention from the underwater acoustic community. This paper presents an application of adjoint methods to acoustic inversion. Inversions are demonstrated in simulation for both range-independent and range-dependent sound speed profiles using the adjoint of a parabolic equation model. Sensitivity and error analyses are discussed showing how the adjoint model enables calculations to be performed in the space of observations, rather than the often much larger space of model parameters. Using an adjoint model enables directions of steepest descent in the model parameters (what we invert for) to be calculated using far fewer modeling runs than if a forward model only were used.},

@article{jeongGeneticAlgorithmBased2017,
	abstract = {Acoustic-source inversion in the time domain can be used for a broad range of engineering applications [for example, detecting speeds and weights of overweight trucks on urban roads and locating underwater moving acoustic sources (i.e.,~naval surveillance)]. However, past studies have not shown whether it is feasible to determine the profiles of moving wave sources without knowing the number of target sources. To fill this knowledge gap, this work presents a genetic algorithm (GA)-based acoustic-source inversion algorithm to identify the amplitudes, positions, and speeds of multiple moving sources by using wave motions recorded at sensors within a heterogeneous one-dimensional solid bar system without knowing the number of targets. To this end, the authors cast this problem into an inverse-source problem, in which solutions can be obtained via minimization of a misfit between measured wave responses and numerically computed responses found using estimated parameters. The wave responses due to moving sources are computed by using the finite element method (FEM) in the time domain. The presented FEM modeling successfully captures the shifts of frequency contents (i.e.,~the Doppler effect) of wave responses that are generated by moving wave sources. The numerical results, for which the GA is used for the minimization process, show that it is possible to detect the parameters of moving sources in a heterogeneous host without knowing how many targeted sources exist in advance. It is also observed that greater computational cost (i.e.,~iteration number of the GA) and denser distribution of sensors are required to detect a larger number of moving wave sources. Similarly, larger computational costs are required for a heterogeneous host than a homogeneous one.},

@article{trederLDABeamformerOptimal2016,
	abstract = {We introduce a novel beamforming approach for estimating event-related potential (ERP) source time series based on regularized linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The optimization problems in LDA and linearly-constrained minimum-variance (LCMV) beamformers are formally equivalent. The approaches differ in that, in LCMV beamformers, the spatial patterns are derived from a source model, whereas in an LDA beamformer the spatial patterns are derived directly from the data (i.e., the ERP peak). Using a formal proof and MEG simulations, we show that the LDA beamformer is robust to correlated sources and offers a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the LCMV beamformer and PCA. As an application, we use EEG data from an oddball experiment to show how the LDA beamformer can be harnessed to detect single-trial ERP latencies and estimate connectivity between ERP sources. Concluding, the LDA beamformer optimally reconstructs ERP sources by maximizing the ERP signal-to-noise ratio. Hence, it is a highly suited tool for analyzing ERP source time series, particularly in EEG/MEG studies wherein a source model is not available.},

@article{tyackeTurbomachinerySimulationChallenges2019,
	abstract = {Dramatic changes to aircraft design are on the horizon to meet ambitious efficiency and emissions targets. This will bring about changes in the role and design of aero-engines, requiring a greater degree of high fidelity, coupled modelling. To bridge a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, modern turbomachinery design employs a wide range of modelling fidelities during different design stages and for different engine components. High fidelity methods such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) have been successfully applied to numerous complex flows where traditional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) modelling does not sufficiently represent flow physics to be consistently accurate. Using LES and, for high Reynolds number flows, hybrid LES-RANS, critical knowledge has been extracted and exploited both to inform designs and to improve lower order modelling. It seems certain that uptake of high fidelity methods will continue at a rapid pace. Here we explore some of the future challenges facing turbomachinery simulation using LES. These include use of higher order schemes, internal and external zonalisation and coupling, exploitation of hardware and pre and post-processing. Although these pose technological barriers, these will enable unexplored design space to be traversed with confidence, resulting in cleaner, quieter, and more efficient aircraft.},

@article{voCriteriaSpikeInitiated2008b,
	abstract = {A computational study to define the phenomena that lead to the onset of short length-scale (spike) rotating stall disturbances has been carried out. Based on unsteady simulations, we hypothesize there are two conditions necessary for the formation of spike disturbances, both of which are linked to the tip clearance flow. One is that the interface between the tip clearance and oncoming flows becomes parallel to the leading-edge plane. The second is the initiation of backflow, stemming from the fluid in adjacent passages, at the trailing-edge plane. The two criteria also imply a circumferential length scale for spike disturbances. The hypothesis and scenario developed are consistent with numerical simulations and experimental observations of axial compressor stall inception. A comparison of calculations for multiple blades with those for single passages also allows statements to be made about the utility of single passage computations as a descriptor of compressor stall.},
